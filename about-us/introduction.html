                        Trekking Agencies' Association of Nepal (TAAN) is an umbrella association of trekking agencies in
                        the country. It was established in 1979 by a handful of trekking agency operators who felt it was
                        time to devise sound business principles as well as regulate the sector which was growing by leaps
                        and bounds with every passing year. They also felt the need of a strong lobby group that could
                        suggest to the government on several issues to promote the Nepali tourism industry and develop
                        tourism as a revenue generating industry.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4>
                        Initially, TAAN had limited its membership only to Nepalese trekking agencies. It later opened
                        associate membership to foreign organizations to broaden the scope of the association.
                    </h4>

                  <p>
                    TAAN members (around 1,729 General Members, 7 Associate Members and 155 General Members of TAAN
                    Regional Association Pokhara) meet annually to endorse policy guidelines which govern the executive
                    body. The executive committee work as per the TAAN Statute and guidelines of the Annual General Body
                    meeting. The association frequently communicates with different government agencies and other
                    stakeholders to simplify working procedures and resolve problems related to the trekking sector. The
                    executive committee, which is elected every two years, has eight office-bearers, nine executive
                    committee members, four nominated executive members, one immediate past president and one
                    representative from TAAN Regional Association Pokhara.
                  </p>

                  
                  <p>
                    TAAN has 17 departments, which are led by office-bearers or executive committee members, which
                    assist the executive committee to meet its objectives. The association organizes different trainings
                    and workshops on a regular basis to enhance professionalism of its member agencies and their
                    workforce. It organizes number of events like TAAN Lhosar Festival (February 17), Langtang Marathon
                    Championship (April 25), International Sagarmatha Day and TAAN Day (May 29), World Environment Day
                    (June 5), and World Tourism Day (September 27), among others. Likewise, programs like tree
                    plantation, trekking trails and rivers clean-up campaign, and works to promote agro tourism and good
                    sanitation are organized throughout the year.
